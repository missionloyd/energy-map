## Usage

```bash
# View map
./run.sh
# Open http://localhost:8080
```

## What's Inside

- **66 balancing authorities** across all US interconnections
- **12 months** of hourly data (energy + temperature)
- **Spearman correlation** (Cohen's guidelines: weak <0.3, moderate <0.5, strong â‰¥0.5)
- **Interactive Leaflet map** with colorblind-friendly markers
- **Scatter plots** for strongest and weakest correlations

## Data Sources

- Energy: [EIA Form 930](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/) (hourly demand, UTC)
- Temperature: [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/) (hourly at region centers, UTC)
